This outage occurred during finals week of the Fall semester, 2010. The PRT
was out of operation during the day (exact times unknown), but running as of
2PM EST. The file is simply a dump of the data using the --printtweets option.

There was a sudden-onset snowstorm in the morning, bringing transportation in
Morgantown mostly to a halt. Road crews were slow to respond, and apparently
the PRT was down sporadically throughout the day.
